# Awesome Digital History of South Asia

[W-I-P] [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Welcome to the South Asian Digital History repository! This project aims to create a comprehensive digital archive and history of the digital in South Asia. Our repository includes both digital archives of historical materials from the region as well as resources for studying the history of the digital in South Asia. Additionally, we have curated resources and links for those interested in learning more about digital history as a discipline.

As a primer to digital history, we have included links to courses on digital humanities, data visualization, and other relevant topics. Our goal is to provide a platform for researchers, students, and enthusiasts interested in South Asian digital history and to help promote the study and practice of digital history as a whole.

South Asia has a rich history and culture, but there is a need for better preservation and access to historical materials. Furthermore, the proliferation of the internet and digital technologies in the region over the past few decades has led to significant social and cultural changes. This repository seeks to address these issues by providing a platform for archiving and studying historical materials from the region, as well as examining the impact of digital technologies on South Asian society and culture.

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in South Asian digital history or digital history as a discipline. Our hope is that this repository will become a valuable resource for those seeking to better understand the history and culture of this dynamic and diverse region, as well as for those looking to explore digital history as a field.
